# Smart Pricing using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting product prices using Machine Learning techniques. It applies **Ridge Regression** along with **Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)** to analyze textual features and estimate optimal pricing.

The aim is to build a data-driven pricing model that can assist in understanding how product descriptions and features influence price.
